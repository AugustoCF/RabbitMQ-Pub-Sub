# RabbitMQ---Publish-and-Subs

Second project of the subject "Sistemas Distribu√≠dos" of UTFPR - Curitiba.

Basically this project was made to help us to understand the concept of the event driven architecture in indirect communication between systems. It was developed in JavaScript, and in the future we will use React to build the front-end of this project.

To help us build this, we used the tutorial of RabbitMQ in https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-javascript.
